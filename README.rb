Project: Viking Store Admin
========================

Author: DAVID WIESENBERG

Note: Project learned as a template from the official solution, and practised by hand. Not tested owing to shortage of time. Plan is to revise and recreate when course is over during the months while I am job searching to make me proficient. 

Official solution (plus Francisco''s partial solution) are in a sub-folder. Note that the former has a number of errors.
