## To Get Going On This Assignment
- add `gem 'json', github: 'flori/json', branch: 'v1.8'` to gemfile
- run `bundle`
- remove `.sqlite` from `database.yml` line 62
- run `rake db:create`
- run `rake db:migrate`
- run `rake db:seed`

- take a look around the schema file to see how models were created
